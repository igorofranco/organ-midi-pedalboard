# Organ Midi Pedalboard

This is a project for personal use. I built the pedalboard using MDF.

## Purpose

Buying a digital organ in Brazil is not for everyone, so I built my own.

## Number of keys

You can change the number of keys inside the `for`, and that number should be the same amount of `false` in `wasKeyDown[]`.

## Take a look

It was honest and passionate work.
